	<h1>Europa</h1>
	<h2>(Jan 8th 1610- )</h2>
	<h3>Gravity 1.315 m/s^2</h3>
	<hr>
	<p class= "flavor">Europa was born in 1610 to parents Galieo and Jupiter. Some speculate Europa was discovered a day earlier, but whether out of malice or sheer inconsideration, Galieo did not acknowledge Europa's existence for a full day. NASA aims to rekindle our relationship with Europa so that we might resume the search for and study of potential alien aquatic life.</p>
	<h4>Funding</h4>
	<p class= "ktc">Until things get so incredibly bad on Earth, there won't be a sense of urgency to study the marginally unfavorable enviromental conditions of Earth-like planets. A drone journey to Europa via modern means is estimated at around 6 years and the mission has been sidebarred until 2020. Meaning if things go bad in 2021 we won't have potentially relevant data for another 5 years. That said, the ozone layer can take a beating. Even the most pessimistic enviromental scientists don't estimate its total degeneration for another 20-25 years. However, personally, I wouldn't mind knowing whether or not there is a record of life under 6 feet of ice. At the very least, I wouldn't mind knowing if we can even land on it.
